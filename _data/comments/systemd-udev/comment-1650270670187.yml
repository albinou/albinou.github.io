message: "<a href=https://world-crypt-es.site>tlm criptomoneda</a>\r\n \r\nAs of April 2020, there were 88 blockchain startups operating in Spain. Such a small crowd of market participants is explained through the temperate bearing of the Spanish government towards cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, as well as the deficit of legislation regulating this area. Cryptocurrencies in Spain do not entertain the standing of licit launch, but settlements with them are not prohibited in the country. \r\n<a href=https://world-crypt-es.site>alice criptomoneda</a>"
