message: "TeamSpeak (known as TS) is a chat app using the world wide web as a pathway for delivering super clear communications. TeamSpeak was originally targeted toward the MMORPG communities. This application was made for accelerating communication in online MMORPGs. However, the same possibilities with gamers became extremely useful for business.
